1. Reflect on (think about) the work you did for the challenge. How did you do? What did you get right? What did you get wrong? What did you do differently (and possibly better) than what was posted in the solution? What was hard to do?

2. How well did you understand the programming concepts and foundational knowledge needed to complete the challenge?

3. How well did you meet the requirements as set out in the challenge? What requirements did you not meet correctly (if any)?

4. How well does your solution match the posted solution? What is different?

5. How could you improve going forward? What don't you still understand that was required for the challenge?

I compeleted what was required for the challenge, which is to build a UI hieraerhy that based on an AnchorPane that contains two different colors and 4 different sizes of rectangles. Besides, the size and color can be changed through menubar.
